### Research Proposal

#### Title

**Making Second-Order Observation Explicit: Transforming Institutional Research into a Cohesive Framework for Functional Differentiation**



### Abstract

Institutional research (IR) operates in a dynamic environment where metrics like GPA, pass rates, and retention rates are interpreted differently by various stakeholders within the university. These divergent interpretations are inherently influenced by the specific functions and priorities of distinct subsystems, such as academic departments, lecturers, and institutional leadership. Drawing on Niklas Luhmann’s theory of second-order observation (SOO), this research proposes making SOO an explicit methodological cornerstone for IR activities. While SOO has always been present in IR work, it has remained implicit and underutilized, limiting its potential to address systemic challenges. By explicitly adopting SOO, IR can enhance its role as a mediator of institutional cohesion, aligning diverse perspectives and fostering reflexivity. This research seeks to explore how explicitly integrating SOO can reconfigure IR practices, improve communication between subsystems, and create inclusive frameworks that contribute to a pluralistic and unified vision of student success.

### Introduction

Institutional research is tasked with interpreting and reconciling a wide range of metrics critical to a university’s operations, including GPA, pass rates, retention, and graduation rates. These metrics, while appearing straightforward, are often understood and applied differently by various stakeholders due to the functional differentiation of subsystems within the university. For example, a lecturer might define a pass rate based on students who completed coursework, while a department head may include all enrolled students. These differing definitions are not contradictions but reflections of the distinct mandates and priorities of each subsystem.

Niklas Luhmann’s theory of second-order observation (SOO) provides a powerful lens to address these challenges. SOO involves observing how others observe, offering insights into the assumptions, contexts, and goals that shape their perspectives. While SOO is inherently present in IR work, it is rarely made explicit, resulting in missed opportunities to mediate between conflicting definitions and foster institutional cohesion.

This research aims to make SOO an explicit methodological framework for IR, exploring its potential to transform IR practices, align diverse perspectives, and create a cohesive approach to institutional success.

### Research Objectives

1. **To analyze the implicit presence of SOO in current IR practices** and identify its impact on interpreting and reconciling key institutional metrics.
2. **To develop a framework for explicitly integrating SOO** into IR activities, making it a methodological cornerstone for interpreting and mediating diverse stakeholder perspectives.
3. **To evaluate the impact of explicitly adopting SOO** on fostering institutional cohesion, improving communication between subsystems, and creating inclusive frameworks for metrics like pass rates and retention rates.
4. **To assess the potential of SOO to enhance IR’s role** in supporting decision-making and achieving a unified vision of student success.

### Theoretical Framework

Luhmann’s theory of social systems emphasizes functional differentiation—the idea that subsystems within an organization operate based on their own logic and priorities. SOO provides a meta-level perspective, enabling researchers to observe how these subsystems define and interpret key variables. By making SOO explicit, IR can better understand and reconcile these differing observations, creating a cohesive framework that aligns localized definitions with institutional goals.

### Methodology

This research will adopt a qualitative, secondary analysis approach, relying on existing reports, academic literature, and case studies to explore the role of SOO in IR.

1. **Phase 1: Document Analysis**
    
    - Analyze existing IR reports and frameworks from universities to identify implicit instances of SOO.
    - Assess how metrics like GPA, pass rates, and retention rates are interpreted and reconciled across subsystems.
2. **Phase 2: Literature Review**
    
    - Conduct an in-depth review of academic literature on Luhmann’s theory of SOO and its application to functional differentiation in organizations.
    - Identify best practices and gaps in current IR methodologies related to SOO.
3. **Phase 3: Case Study Analysis**
    
    - Examine documented case studies of IR practices in higher education institutions to identify patterns and examples of SOO.
    - Compare cases where SOO is implicitly present with cases where explicit frameworks for integrating multiple perspectives are lacking.
4. **Phase 4: Framework Development and Testing**
    
    - Develop a methodological framework for explicitly integrating SOO into IR practices.
    - Apply the framework to hypothetical scenarios based on the analyzed secondary data to test its validity and utility.

### Expected Outcomes

1. A comprehensive analysis of how SOO is implicitly present in IR activities.
2. A practical framework for explicitly integrating SOO into IR practices.
3. Evidence of improved communication and collaboration among university subsystems.
4. Insights into how explicit use of SOO can enhance IR’s role as a mediator of institutional cohesion.
5. Recommendations for scaling the SOO framework to other metrics and institutions.

### Significance of the Research

By making SOO an explicit methodological cornerstone, this research seeks to reconfigure IR practices to address the complexities of functional differentiation within universities. This approach not only enhances IR’s relevance and impact but also fosters a more inclusive and pluralistic vision of student success. The findings will contribute to the academic discourse on institutional research and offer practical tools for IR professionals seeking to navigate the challenges of diverse stakeholder perspectives.

### Executive Summary

This research proposes making Niklas Luhmann’s second-order observation (SOO) an explicit methodological cornerstone in institutional research (IR). SOO, which involves observing the observations of others, is inherently present in IR work but often remains implicit, limiting its potential to address systemic challenges. By explicitly adopting SOO, IR can transform its role, fostering institutional cohesion and creating inclusive frameworks for interpreting key metrics like GPA, pass rates, and retention rates.

The research will analyze the implicit use of SOO in current IR practices through document analysis, literature reviews, and case study analysis. It will develop a framework for explicitly integrating SOO and evaluate its potential impact through secondary data. By positioning SOO as a structuring methodology, the research aims to enhance IR’s capacity to mediate between diverse perspectives, align localized and institutional definitions, and contribute to a unified vision of student success.

The expected outcomes include a comprehensive analysis of SOO in IR, a practical framework for its explicit use, and evidence of its impact on institutional cohesion. This research will not only advance academic discourse on IR but also provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to navigate the complexities of functional differentiation within universities.
